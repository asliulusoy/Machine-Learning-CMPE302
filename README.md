# Machine Learning : CMPE 302 - 2024

In this course, we learned the workings and underlying mathematics of many different artificial intelligence algorithms. In the practical parts of the course, we coded these algorithms. This repository was created to keep the code I wrote in the practical sessions organized and to share my knowledge.
